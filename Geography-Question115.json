It is also Europe\'s largest river in terms of discharge and drainage basin.\nThe river flows through central Russia and into the Caspian Sea, and is widely regarded as the national river of Russia, being an important river for mainly Slavic, Turkic people, Iranian cultures such as Scythians and Sarmatians, Finno-Ugric and Germanic people (Vikings and Goths), Greeks and cultures of Byzantine and Sasanian Empires.\nDue to its geographical situation the Volga played an important role in the movement of people between east and west (from Asia to Europe) as well as south and north.
