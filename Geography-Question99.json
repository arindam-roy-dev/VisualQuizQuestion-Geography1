"aboutAnswer":"The Port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe, located in the city of Rotterdam, Netherlands.\nFrom 1962 until 2004 it was the world\'s busiest port, now overtaken first by Singapore and then Shanghai. In 2011, Rotterdam was the world\'s eleventh-largest container port in terms of twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) handled (2009: tenth; 2008: ninth, 2006: sixth). In 2012 Rotterdam was the world\'s sixth-largest port in terms of annual cargo tonnage.\nCovering 105 square kilometres (41 sq mi), the port of Rotterdam now stretches over a distance of 40 kilometres (25 mi).\nIt consists of the city centre\'s historic harbour area, including Delfshaven; the Maashaven/Rijnhaven/Feijenoord complex; the harbours around Nieuw-Mathenesse; Waalhaven; Vondelingenplaat; Eemhaven; Botlek; Europoort, situated along the Calandkanaal, Nieuwe Waterweg and Scheur (the latter two being continuations of the Nieuwe Maas); and the reclaimed Maasvlakte area, which projects into the North Sea."
