"aboutAnswer":"The Registan Desert, is an extremely arid plateau region located between Helmand and Kandahar provinces in southwestern Afghanistan.\nIt is a sandy desert consisting of small, red sand hills about 50 to 100 feet (30 m) high, sand-covered plains, and open rocky and clay-covered areas.\nThe underlying base of the hills consists of partly stabilized ancient transverse dunes, reflecting a west-to-east wind and nearly unlimited sand supply.\nThe desert is very sparsely populated by Baluchi and Pashtun nomads. The desert is gradually encroaching on surrounding agricultural areas."
