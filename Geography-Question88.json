"aboutAnswer":"Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano. They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent.\nAs the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders, clinkers, or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical; with slopes between 30–40°; and a nearly circular ground plan. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit."
