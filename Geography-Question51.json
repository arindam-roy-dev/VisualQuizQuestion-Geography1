"aboutAnswer":"Pemba Island is an island forming part of the Zanzibar Archipelago, lying within the Swahili Coast in the Indian Ocean.\nZanzibar is a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania.\nTZanzibar, mainly Pemba Island, was once the world\'s leading clove producer, but annual clove sales have plummeted by 80 percent since the 1970s. Zanzibar\'s clove industry has been crippled by a fast-moving global market, international competition, and a hangover from Tanzania\'s failed experiment with socialism in the 1960s and 1970s, when the government controlled clove prices and exports. Zanzibar now ranks a distant third with Indonesia supplying 75 percent of the world\'s cloves compared to Zanzibar\'s 7 percent."
