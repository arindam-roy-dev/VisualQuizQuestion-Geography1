"aboutAnswer":"The Troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere, and is also where nearly all weather conditions take place. It contains approximately 75% of the atmosphere's mass and 99% of the total mass of water vapor and aerosols. This layer is typically a few hundred meters to 2 KM. Most of the phenomena associated with day-to-day weather occur in the Troposphere."
