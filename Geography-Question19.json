"aboutAnswer":"The heliosphere is the vast, bubble-like region of space which surrounds and is created by the Sun.\nIn plasma physics terms, this is the cavity formed by the Sun in the surrounding interstellar medium. The \"bubble\" of the heliosphere is continuously \"inflated\" by plasma originating from the Sun, known as the solar wind.\nOutside the heliosphere, this solar plasma gives way to the interstellar plasma permeating our galaxy. Radiation levels inside and outside the heliosphere differ; in particular, the galactic cosmic rays are less abundant inside the heliosphere, so that the planets inside (including Earth) are partly shielded from their impact."
