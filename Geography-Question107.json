"aboutAnswer":"Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population.\nIts 3,748,148 (2018) inhabitants make it the second most populous city proper of the European Union after London. The city is one of Germany\'s 16 federal states.\nIt is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg, and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg\'s capital. The two cities are at the center of the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region, which is, with about six million inhabitants and an area of more than 30,000 km², Germany\'s third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions.\nBerlin straddles the banks of the River Spree, which flows into the River Havel (a tributary of the River Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau.\nAmong the city\'s main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel, and Dahme rivers (the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee). Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. About one-third of the city\'s area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.\nBerlin has an oceanic climate – degraded by its interior location and farther from the west (Cfb), the eastern part of the city has a slight continental influence (Dfb), especially in the 0°C isotherm, one of the changes being the annual rainfall according to the air masses and the greater abundance during a period of the year."
