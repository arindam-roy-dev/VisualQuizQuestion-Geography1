"aboutAnswer":"Metropolitan France uses Central European Time (UTC+01:00) and Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00). Daylight saving time is observed in Metropolitan France from the last Sunday in March (02:00 CET) to the last Sunday in October (03:00 CEST).\nWith its overseas territories, France uses 12 different time zones, more than any other country in the world.\nGMT+1 is the the official time of Metropolitan France.\nIn 1976, daylight saving time (summer time) was reintroduced in Metropolitan France for the first time since WW2 because of the oil crisis, and since 1976 Metropolitan France has thus been at GMT+1 (now UTC+01:00) during the winter and GMT+2 (now UTC+02:00) during the summer. In 1996, daylight saving time was harmonized throughout the European Union by Directive 2000/84/EC, which moved the end of DST to the last Sunday in October."
