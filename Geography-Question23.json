"aboutAnswer":"The Netherlands remains the center of production for the European floral market, as well as a major international supplier to other continents.\nThe flower auction at Aalsmeer is the largest flower market in the world. Since the mid-1970's, the production and distribution of cut flowers in Netherlands has burgeoned.\nIn 1995, Dutch growers produced over 8 billion blooms and the flower auctions collectively traded more than 5.4 billion euro (about $3.2 billion) in cut flowers and potted plants, contributing over 8 billion euro annually."
