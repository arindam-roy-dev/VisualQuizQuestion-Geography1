"aboutAnswer":"Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis, is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan. It has served as the Japanese capital since 1869.\nAs of 2018, the Greater Tokyo Area ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world. The urban area houses the seat of the Emperor of Japan, of the Japanese government and of the National Diet.\nTokyo forms part of the Kantō region on the southeastern side of Japan\'s main island, Honshu, and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands.\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft). Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area stretching westwards.\nThe region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag, with the warmest month being August, which averages 26.4°C (79.5°F), and the coolest month being January, averaging 5.2°C (41.4°F)."
